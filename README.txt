## Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Board.java: 

Represents the game board and handles operations related to it.
Supports different board sizes through the constructor.
The use of a 2D array (Cell[][]) allows for scalability to various board dimensions.

BoardGame.java:

The introduction of an interface allows for the addition of more turn-based games without
modifying existing classes.
Any new game needs to implement the BoardGame interface, ensuring a standardized set of
methods

Cell.java: 

Represents individual cells on the board with a value (X, O, or empty).
Ensures encapsulation with private val variable and appropriate getter and setter methods.
The isEmpty() method allows for easy checking of empty cells.

Player.java: 

Represents a player in the game.
Allows for customization of player name and marker (e.g., X or O).
Encapsulates player-related functionality.

TicTacToe.java: 

Manages the game logic for classic Tic Tac Toe.
Integrates with the Board and Player classes.
Provides methods for playing the game, making moves, and checking game completion.

SuperTicTacToe.java: 

Extension of Tic Tac Toe for a super-sized variant.
Utilizes a 2D array of Tic Tac Toe boards (superTicTacToe) to implement the larger game.
Introduces the concept of a super board and handles player moves within sub-boards.
Coordinates with the TicTacToe class for individual board logic.

OandC.java: 

Represents the Order and Chaos game variant.
Extends the core Board class.
Implements specific game rules for Order and Chaos.

Menu.java:

Provides a simple menu system for choosing different game variants.
Ensures user input validation for menu choices.
Handles decisions for playing again or exiting the game.

WinRules.java: 

Contains static methods to check for game-winning conditions.
Generalized methods like checkWin and specific methods like OrderandChaosWin.
Easily extensible for new game variants with different win conditions.

Main.java: 

Drives the program by presenting the user with a menu to choose a game variant.
Coordinates the initiation of selected games.
